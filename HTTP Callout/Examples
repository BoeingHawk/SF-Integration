Example Scenario 1:
--> Connect Salesforce with the ZipCode API to pass the zipcode and fetch the Cityname into Salesforce Org.

#Identification: Salesforce data is not exposed as it only wants data from the external/3rd party system.

Which API will be used: HTTP Callout


--> Steps to do to achieve this task:

#Steps inside POSTMAN & API(endpoint)

1) Sign up for the API and get the API KEY
2) Open POSTMAN and click on the NEW REQUEST (+ icon on the top) and then make sure the METHOD is GET and pass the URL with the Query Parameter (that contains the API Key as well). 

//Example: http://api.zipcodestack.com/v1/search?apikey=zip_live_OIdUEzsHGzuaKvl6rsk8kyQ5AcJyhqxcsXYnSjyu&codes=10001&country=US

Structure of URL: Domain+Path+Query Parameters with key and values

Check the image added in the Repo. 

3) Check the returned status (it should be 200 OK) and also checked the returned data.

4) Once the data and status is confirmed, everything is okay and we can proceed to continue to use the API in the APEX and call it via LWC or FLOW. 


#Steps inside Salesforce

1) Add the Endpoint URL in the Remote Site Settings, so that a secured callout is made from Salesforce.

2) Create an Apex Class in order to get the data from the API.

Apex Class is as below:
