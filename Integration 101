API used is REST API


//Task 1:
// API: https://gorest.co.in/

Things Learnt in the process:

1) Downloading the Postman API Tool
2) Making a callout to an Open API using GET Method
3) Making a callout to an Open API using POST Method
4) Inserting new data using POST Method, by passing data in the request Body.
5) Info about Authorization Header and passing the Access Token to the Header for Authorization


//Task 2:
API: https://spoonacular.com/food-api






HTTP Callout = When we want ot make a callout to an External System from Salesforce 

REST API = When Salesforce is exposed to the outside/3rd Party, so that new records or data can be shared.





Types of Integration in Salesforce:

1) Callout: 
How to identify: Check if Salesforce data is exposed or not to the 3rd party or any other system?

General Scenario: You want to connect your Salesforce org to a external/3rd party system (like weather API, Zipcode API) to get the data from the API.


Scenario:
Connect Salesforce with the ZipCode API to pass the zipcode and fetch the Cityname into Salesforce Org.

#Identification: Salesforce data is not exposed as it only wants data from the external/3rd party system.

Which API will be used: HTTP Callout


Steps to do to achieve this task:

1) Sign up for the API and get the API KEY
2) Open POSTMAN and click on the NEW REQUEST (+ icon on the top) and then make sure the METHOD is GET and pass the URL with the Query Parameter (that contains the API Key as well). 

//Example: http://api.zipcodestack.com/v1/search?apikey=zip_live_OIdUEzsHGzuaKvl6rsk8kyQ5AcJyhqxcsXYnSjyu&codes=10001&country=US

Structure of URL: Domain+Path+Query Parameters with key and values

Check the image added in the Repo. 

3) Check the returned status (it should be 200 OK) and also checked the returned data.

4) Once the data and status is confirmed, everything is okay and we can proceed to continue to use the API in the APEX and call it via LWC or FLOW.
